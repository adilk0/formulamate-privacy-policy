    <h1>Privacy Policy for FormulaMate</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <strong>December 13, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>
      FormulaMate (“the app”, “we”, “our”, “us”) is developed by <strong>Adil Khan</strong>.
      This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use FormulaMate.
      By using the app, you agree to the practices described below.

    <section class="section">
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
      <p>
        FormulaMate does <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account or sign in.
        We do not ask for personal information such as name, phone number, or address.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you contact us via email, we will only use your email address to respond to your inquiry.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Data (Non-Personal)</h3>
      <p>
        FormulaMate uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display banner, interstitial, and rewarded ads.
        AdMob and related ad networks may automatically collect non-personal information such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (Advertising ID)</li>
        <li>IP address and approximate (non-GPS) location</li>
        <li>App usage events and ad interaction data</li>
        <li>Crash reports and diagnostics</li>

        For more information, see
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads policies</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Rewarded Ads</h3>
      <p>
        When you choose to watch a rewarded ad, the ad network may collect anonymous data required to
        deliver the ad and verify the reward. FormulaMate does not track individual viewing behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>3. One-Time Pro Purchase (In-App Purchase)</h2>
      <p>
        FormulaMate offers an optional <strong>one-time Pro purchase</strong> using
